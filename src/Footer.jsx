            <h5 className="bg-blue-100">“Many animal rescue organizations hit with a hard-core, heartbreaking message. Their videos and stories can become difficult for average people to watch. By taking a more positive, heartwarming approach to animal rescue, I’ve been able to engage people and keep them engaged for years. Instead of selling the agony and misery – and sadly, there is no shortage of that – I start with the happy endings. I work backwards so the first message they get is joy and success due to their involvement. Opening the mind with humor and joy gets the rescue message in that much deeper.” — Elayne Boosler</h5>
